## What is this?

This is a toy direction field viewer based on Lesson 5 of 
"Ordinary Differential Equations" by Tenenbaum and Pollard.

You can play around with it here: https://davidmis.github.io/DirectionField

## What can I use it for?

Playing with differential equations! Other than that, probably nothing. It's just for fun. 

If you are looking for a general-purpose in-browser graphing tool, try D3.js.

If you are looking for general-purpose mathematical computation languages, start
with Python or R. You probably don't want to use Javascript for any serious work
unless you absolutely have to and really know the gotchas of the language.
